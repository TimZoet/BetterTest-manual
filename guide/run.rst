Running the Test Suite
======================

Running the test suite is as simple as launching the executable. Depending on the selected output format, one or more
files are generated. These files will contain the test results, specifying for each test and check whether or not they
succeeded and, if not, why. See :doc:`../output`.

To run specific tests, run tests in parallel, specify an output format and more, various command line arguments can be
passed. See :doc:`../cmd`.

When running the test suite multiple times, results are appended to whatever was already stored on disk.
